#This is an example script that will let you run a series of repetitive jobs 
#at the same time. Essentially, the PBS script will split your jobs and spread
#the jobs across multiple processors (as many as you requested per job). 

#This script in particular runs 5 jobs simultaneously, each job will correspond
#to one subject (enumerated in the array "sublist"). At the same time


#!/bin/bash
#PBS -l mem=16gb,nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime=5:00:00
#PBS -m abe -M [your email here]
#PBS -t 0-4 #[this is the line where you specify the number of jobs to cycle through]

bash
source .bash_profile
module load [whichever modules your particular script needs]

sublist=('01' '02' '03' '04' '05')
sub=${sublist[${PBS_ARRAYID}]}  #this line uses the variable PBS_ARRAYID which comes from line 12

python [your python script here] ${sub}  #this line runs a python script and passes your subject as an input
